Async rust concepts covered in our Mini-Tokio project


Asynchronous Rust operations are lazy and require a caller to poll them.
    We usually do this with .await, but it looks like .join()! and .select()! can do the same thing with a macro
Wakers are passed to futures to link a future to the task calling it.

when a resource is not ready to complet an operation. Poll::Pending is returned and task's waker is recorded.
when the resource becomes ready, the task's waker is notified.

The executor receives the nottifiction and schedules the task to execute.
In other words, the wake method is called, letting the executor know that the method should be polled again

The task is polled again, this time the resource is ready and task makes progress.
